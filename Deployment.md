# Deployment

## Prerequisite 
- Docker and Docker Compose must be installed 
    - Install here (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
    - It is recommended that you deploy this on a Linux server for less overhead. It is possible to deploy this on other OS, but it will be more complicated and resource intensive. 
        - For example, to install Docker on Windows, you will need WSL2 or Hyper-V installed.
